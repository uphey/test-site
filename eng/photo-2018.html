Is “I have infinite creativity” competent for  creative work? What is the line between confident and arrogant? A sincere  attitude with a self-recommendation letter or a self-introduction that matches  the application requests allow students to illustrate their potential,  presenting themselves precisely while impressing the interviewer or the  employer. The ability to tailor the designated content and to choose the  suitable words according to the application requests will enable students to  perform decently and as a result, increasing the chance of success.

  "For me chemistry represented  an indefinite cloud of future potentialities which enveloped my life to come in  black volutes torn by fiery flashes, like those which had hidden Mount Sinai.  Like Moses, from that cloud I expected my law, the principle of order in me, around  me, and in the world. I was fed up with books, which I still continued to gulp  down with indiscreet voracity, and searched for a key to the highest  truths."-Primo Levi: The Periodic Table
